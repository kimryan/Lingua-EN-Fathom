SYNOPSIS

   print($text->report);


DESCRIPTION

This module analyses English text in either a string or file. Totals are
then calculated for the number of characters, words, sentences, blank
and non blank (text) lines and paragraphs.

Three common readability statistics are also derived, the Fog, Flesch and
Kincaid indices.

All of these properties can be accessed through individual methods, or by
generating a text report.

A hash of all unique words and the number of times they occur is generated.
